# Droplet

A small Foundry VTT module to add a few drag & drop related features.

## Item drag & drop
Allows GMs and players to drag & drop items onto tokens to directly transfer the item from one inventory to another. This also allows for the transfor of items from the item sidebar or in line mentions. 
A few settings can be adjusted:
- Show transfer in chat: if a chat message should be created, containing the transfer details
- Allow player item transfer: to set the rules under which players can transfer items
- Delete item on transfer: if items should be deleted when transfered from one inventory to another (can be inverted by holding ALT)
- Ask for transfer amount: to open a dialog which allows for the amount of transfered items to be set (can be inverted by holding CTRL)
- Apply settings to sheet drops: to apply all settings to character sheet drops

## Scene drag & drop
This allows the GM to quickly transfer players from one scene to another by dragging their name from the bottom left list to a scene in the nav bar at the top

### Languages:
